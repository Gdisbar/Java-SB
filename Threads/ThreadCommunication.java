Thread Synchronization
--------------------------------------------------------------------
When multiple threads access shared data simultaneously â†’ Race conditions occur.
Synchronization ensures that only one thread accesses the critical section at a time.

- Synchronized Method (Only one thread can access a synchronized method at a time.)
- Synchronized Block (Allows finer control over the lock)

2. Livelocks
   - Similar to a deadlock but threads continuously change state in response to each 
   other without making progress.
   - Example: Two threads repeatedly try to acquire the same locks and release them 
   upon detecting contention.

3. Thread Starvation  
   - Occurs when low-priority threads never get CPU time because high-priority threads 
   keep executing.
   - Solution: Fair scheduling policies or priority adjustments.
